Certainly! Here's a theoretical overview of each section of the code:

### 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
- **Loading Data:** Reads a CSV file into a DataFrame, ensuring correct handling of date strings and large datasets.
- **Date Conversion:** Converts date strings to datetime objects for easier manipulation and analysis.

### 2. **Aggregation and Lag Calculation**
- **Weekly Aggregation:** Groups the data by week and counts unique users. Lagged values help analyze trends over time.
- **Projection Calculation:** Estimates future user counts based on past data, applying a growth rate to the lagged values.

### 3. **Feature Engineering and Data Preparation**
- **Feature Extraction:** Creates new features from datetime information (e.g., hour, day of week) to improve model performance.
- **Lag Features:** Adds previous values (lags) to the dataset to capture temporal dependencies.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Time Series Split:** Uses cross-validation tailored for time series to ensure that training and testing data are properly split by time.
- **Pipeline and Preprocessing:** Defines a pipeline for scaling and dimensionality reduction before applying a random forest regressor.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Searches for the best model parameters using GridSearchCV.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

### 5. **Prediction and Visualization**
- **Prediction:** Uses the trained model to forecast token usage for future time periods.
- **Visualization:** Plots actual, predicted, and lagged token counts to visually compare the model's performance.

### 6. **Data Export**
- **CSV Export:** Saves the weekly projections and aggregated user data to CSV files for further analysis or reporting.
